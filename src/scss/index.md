        Fortitude was architected around one simple principle:
        keep developers out of the css and provide them with a
        consistent API to compose views, all in markup.

      <p>
        Good vertical rhythm guides the user's gaze comfortably
        through your content by ensuring consistent,
        predictable vertical spacing between all elements.
        Everything in Fortitude respects a base vertical unit of
        size.

        block__element--modifier syntax keeps you out of the
        documentation and in the markup. Fortitude classes
        follow consistent conventions. You'll be amazed at how
        often you 'guess right' at the class you need. For more,
        check out this article MindBEMding &mdash; getting your head
        &apos;round BEM syntax by Harry Roberts.

      <p>
        Fortitude classes apply the styles you want without a
        ridiculous incomprehensible tree of 'inheritance'. When
        you need new functionality, extending Fortitude is a
        breeze, and you won't spend time playing wack-a-mole
        in your CSS if you follow the fortitude conventions
        outlined here.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Unlike &lt;mocking&gt;soooome&lt;/mocking&gt; frameworks, Fortitude doesn't get into your way. You think in visual styles instead of abstract component names, and we don't dump an entire visual codebase into your project. It's up to you to establish a visual theme with a designer or a tool like Adobe Kuler.
